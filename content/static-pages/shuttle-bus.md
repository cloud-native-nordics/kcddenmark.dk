We're excited to announce that for KCD Denmark 2023, we've arranged a special shuttle bus service to enhance your experience at the event. Recognizing that transportation can be challenging, especially for those coming from afar, our single shuttle bus will operate from a key location in the city to take attendees directly to the venue. This service aims to provide an added layer of convenience and comfort, making your journey to the event as hassle-free as possible. We look forward to seeing you there!

Please use the following sign up form to secure your spot on the bus!
