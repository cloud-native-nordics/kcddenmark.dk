*KCD* Denmark is the first of its kind in Denmark, and all generated profit will be donated to the *non-profit* organisation *[Coding Pirates](https://codingpirates.dk/)* supporting IT Creativity for children.

KCD *shares knowledge* though the *community*, that is why our ticket price is only a *symbolic* amount covering the basic expenses. It is important to *engage* as many community members as possible, even those with limited resources.

The KCD format adopts a *strict code of conduct* to *eliminate any discrimination* and provide a harassment-free environment. KCD will prioritize *high quality talks* from *end-users* with a real life experience in *DevOps* practice and *Cloud Native* technologies.
