"**Kubernetes Community Days Denmark** is a community-driven event that aims to bring together Kubernetes enthusiasts from around the region to learn, share knowledge, and network with each other. We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for attendees of all experience levels, from beginners to experts. Our goal is to promote the adoption of Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies and to provide a platform for community members to share their experiences and best practices. We believe in the power of collaboration and community to drive innovation and the future of cloud computing.

Additionally, we are committed to being a carbon-neutral event and will work to offset any carbon emissions associated with the event through environmentally-conscious initiatives. In line with our commitment to sustainability, we will only serve vegetarian and vegan food options at the event. Furthermore, we are committed to reducing trash as much as possible at the event and will encourage the use of reusable containers and other eco-friendly practices. Above all, we embrace diversity and inclusivity and welcome attendees from all backgrounds and identities to join us at Kubernetes Community Days Denmark."
